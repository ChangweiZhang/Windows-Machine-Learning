# Windows ML samples

This repo contains sample apps that demonstrate how to use Windows ML to build machine learning applications for Windows 10.

For tutorials, how-tos, and additional information, see the Windows ML documentation:
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/machine-learning

## Sample apps

These generic examples show how to use various models and input feeds with Windows ML. 

- **MNIST**: Uses the MNIST model to recognize a numeric digit drawn by the user.
- **SqueezeNet**: Uses the SqueezeNet model to detect the predominant object in an image.
- **WinMLExplorer**: Uses a circuit board defect detection model to detect defects from images or a real-time camera feed.
- **[Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models](https://github.com/ChangweiZhang/Awesome-WindowsML-ONNX-Models)**: An project provides the largest collection of tested ONNX machine learning models ande demos for develpers,to help integrate machine learning features more easily. it also provide a ONNX model generator that is able to convert CoreML models to ONNX format.

## Requirements
